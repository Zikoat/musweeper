# todo
- [x] implement monte carlo tree (with tsts)
- [x] implement model mock (with tests)

- [x] implement better way of doing replay buffering
- [X] implement self play


## things to debug
- [x] model input and output
- [x] ucb score
    - [x] values are high, see if there is something wrongly computed by 
- [ ] the target values are wrong
    - [ ] I looked at the psuedo code connected to the paper and seems like the value is not the same that we calculate during the MCTS. So fix that.
